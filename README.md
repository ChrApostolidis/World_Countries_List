# Country Search and Sort Application

## Overview
This project is a simple web application that allows users to search and sort a list of countries. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application enables users to filter countries based on their names, either by checking if a country starts with a specific string or contains it anywhere in the name. Additionally, users can sort the list of countries in ascending or descending order.

### Features

#### Search Functionality:

* Users can search for countries by entering a string in the search bar.
There are two search modes:
Starts With: Filters countries that start with the entered string.
Contains: Filters countries that contain the entered string anywhere in the name.
Sort Functionality:

* Users can sort the list of countries alphabetically in either ascending or descending order.
The sort button updates dynamically to reflect the current sorting order.
Responsive UI: The user interface adapts to various screen sizes and provides a smooth user experience.

#### How It Works

#### Search

* Starts With: When the "Starts With" button is activated, the application filters the list of countries to only those whose names start with the string entered in the search bar.

* Contains: When the "Contains" button is activated, the application filters the list of countries to those that include the string anywhere in their names.

* Sort
The sort button toggles the sorting order between ascending and descending when clicked. The list is automatically re-sorted when the search term is updated.
